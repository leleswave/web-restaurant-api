# Web Restaurant API

This project implements a **GraphQL API** for a restaurant, allowing queries for the full menu and fetching information about different categories of dishes, including **appetizers**, **entrees**, **sandwiches**, **tacos**, **enchiladas**, **fajitas**, **quiche**, and **green salads**.

## ðŸ”€ Branch Information

* **ðŸŒ³ `main` Branch:** This branch contains the core implementation of the GraphQL API for the restaurant menu.
* **ðŸ’¾ `SQLite` Branch:** This branch contains an implementation demonstrating how to connect the API with a SQLite database.
* **ðŸ’» `cmd` Branch:** This branch includes a small Node.js script designed to run as a binary. It allows users to execute GraphQL queries against the restaurant API directly from the terminal.


## Technologies Used (Main)

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for the server.
- **GraphQL**: API for flexible and efficient data querying.
- **Mocha**: Test framework for JavaScript.
- **Chai**: Assertion library for testing APIs and functions.
- **Express**: Web framework for building the server.


## Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need to have **Node.js** installed. To check the versions, use the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

The recommended version of **Node.js** for this project is **v23.5.0** (or higher). The **npm** version should be **11.1.0**.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leleswave/web-restaurant-api.git
cd web-restaurant-api
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Running the API

To run the API, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start and be available at `http://localhost:4000/graphql`. You can use this URL to test your API with a tool like **Postman** or **GraphiQL**.

## Testing the API

The project uses **Mocha** for automated testing. To run the tests, use the command:

```bash
npm test
```

The tests cover the following aspects of the API:

- **Menu Categories**: Verifies that the menu categories are populated correctly and are not empty.
- **Item Prices**: Ensures that prices are valid numbers and correctly set.
- **Menu Items**: Verifies that menu items have non-empty names, valid prices, and that certain categories contain vegetarian items, different prices, and tacos priced over 9.

Example of test output:

```
  GraphQL API Category
    âœ” should fetch items by category
    âœ” should have at least two items in the sandwiches category
    âœ” should ensure enchiladas category is not empty

  GraphQL API Prices
    âœ” should fetch entrees with price
    âœ” should fetch sandwiches with full and half price
    âœ” should fetch enchiladas with valid prices
    âœ” should fetch soup and salad combos with valid prices
    âœ” should fetch quiche menu with price
    âœ” should have price as a number for all items
    âœ” should have all prices greater than zero
    âœ” should fetch green salads with different prices
    âœ” should have tacos with prices greater than 9

  GraphQL API General
    âœ” should fetch the full menu
    âœ” should fetch valid fajitas
    âœ” should return correct menu item for a taco
    âœ” should have non-null names for all menu items
    âœ” should have non-empty names for all menu items
    âœ” should fetch vegetarian tacos
    âœ” should have fajitas with 'Steak' in their name
